/*Exercise 5- Insertion and Selection Sorts
 * 
 * Trace the execution of the insertion and selection sort algorithms when executed on the
 * following array of integers: {1, 29, 14, 15, 94} Show how the array will look like after 
 * each iteration of the outer loop.
 * 
 * Insertion Sort:
 * Given a list, iterate through the element by index and insert it in the appropriate 
 * position in the list.
 * 
 * Step 1: {1, 29, 14, 15, 94} 
 * Step 2: {1, 14, 29, 15, 94} 
 * Step 3: {1, 14, 29, 15, 94} 
 * Step 4: {1, 14, 15, 29, 94} 
 * Step 5: {1, 14, 29, 15, 94} 
 * 
 * 
 * Selection Sort:
 * Given a list take the smallest element and switch its index with the first element in the 
 * list. 
 * 
 * Step 1: {1, 29, 14, 15, 94} 
 * Step 2: {1, 14, 29, 15, 94} 
 * Step 3: {1, 14, 15, 29, 94} 
 * Step 4: {1, 14, 15, 29, 94} 
 * Step 5: {1, 14, 15, 29, 94}
